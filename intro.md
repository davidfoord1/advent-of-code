A personal project of solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I love these challenges as they give me a refreshing and stimulating way to get more comfortable coding, thinking about algorithms as well as just being being a fun set of puzzles.

As some kind of data analyst I am usually transforming and visualising data in
Excel and R. I'm taking this as an opportunity to try out different kinds of
operations and to pick up Python.
