Previous years have taught me to reach for modulo when dealing with cycles, and part 1 was pretty comfy. However, I took a long time stumbling on part 2 with floor division and adjusting for my undercounting. I did get there in the end with my R solution, and then went on to try using Python just to run through every click, which turned out to be a much simpler with a faster time-to-solution.
