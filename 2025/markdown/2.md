Learning from my issues with floor division on day 1, I went straight to trying every possible string chunk for day 2. Good enough! After seeing the simplicity of regex solutions later, I went ahead and replaced my part 2 solution with that.

I do find "brute force" to be easier with Python than R, but I guess my brain jumps to for loops too much before vectorised and *apply/map operations. It feels easier to me to reason about an item/index in an iterable.
