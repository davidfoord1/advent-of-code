title: "R/Python Advent of Code Solutions"

A personal project of solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I love these challenges as they give me a refreshing and stimulating way to get more comfortable coding, thinking about algorithms as well as just being being a fun set of puzzles.

As some kind of data analyst I am primarily apply business logic as data
transformations in Excel and R. I'm taking this as an opportunity to try out
different operations and to pick up Python. I'd say it's stepping out of
my comfort zone, but perhaps by nature of my apparent obsession, I'm stepping
*into* it.
